Moraspirit Volunteer Management System
==========================================

Moraspirit is a community to  uplift university sports to the highest of standards, create intelligent and well-rounded university undergraduates instilled with invaluable qualities and disciplines nurtured by sports and also to draw interest of authorities and other stakeholders towards them.
More than a website, MoraSpirit acts as a social network itself, gathering the university community together, forming a sports culture. 

Currently, MoraSpirit is a fully functional entity housing a dynamic crew of 105 voluntary members, covering almost all university sports events. In addition, it carries out programs for sportsmen/women at the University of Moratuwa. 

Even though the service is rendered out of volunteering passion and for the love of sports we at Moraspirit value every inch of dedication and commitment put out by our Spiriters to support the organization, to meet its goals. 

Volma (Volunteer Management System) is the new implementation to provide the flexibility and usability in allocating resource personnel to individual tasks and rate their work with two way feedback system. 

Spiriters (volunteers), Pillar Heads and the CXOâ€™s are the main types of users in the system. CXO can create projects and appoint a person to oversee the project as the project chair-person and in return he/she can create tasks for a given project and assign task managers for each task. Every spiriter will have a given task to complete before a prior deadline setup by the Project Manager and the task will be completed if the project manager is satisfied. The project manager will provide a rating and a feedback to the task conducted by the task manager which will be added to his/her profile. Once all tasks are completed the project will be terminated by an CXO providing a rating and a feedback to the project manager as well. 

Through this rating and feedback system Pillar heads can easily identify which spiriter is the most working person and the spiriters will get valuable feedback from others for his/her work done which can significantly improve their performance next time. 

This also helps the HR pillar to monitor each and every Spiriter to check if everyone is involved in some activity and to recognize hard working Spiriters and acknowledge them.
